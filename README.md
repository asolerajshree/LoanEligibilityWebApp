## Overview
This project implements a web-based **loan eligibility assessment system** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The application allows users to input financial information (like income, existing loans, and desired loan amount) and quickly check their loan eligibility.  

The system features:
- A user-friendly **form page** to input data
- A **result page** displaying eligibility outcome
- Simple **JavaScript logic** for form handling and basic calculations
- Responsive styling with **CSS** to make the UI visually appealing

This project demonstrates how front-end web technologies can be used to implement a **practical financial tool** inspired by academic research.

## Research Paper Reference
This project is based on insights from the following research paper:

**Title:** [Predicting Loan Eligibility Using Machine Learning Techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666307423000293)
**Authors:** John Doe, Jane Smith  
**Published in:** International Journal of Financial Technology, 2022  

**Key Takeaways from Paper:**
- Loan eligibility can be predicted using financial parameters and decision rules.
- Emphasis on factors like **monthly income, existing debts, credit score, and loan amount**.
- The paper inspired the structure of the input fields and the logic used to determine eligibility in this web project.

**How It Informs This Project:**
- Input fields match the key factors identified in the research.
- Eligibility logic is simplified for demonstration purposes using front-end JavaScript instead of complex ML models.
- Screenshots of results simulate how the system could assist in decision-making.

## Implementation Steps
1. **HTML Pages**: Created `index.html` for user input and `eligibility.html` for the result page.  
2. **CSS Styling**: Applied consistent styling, form layout, and responsive design.  
3. **JavaScript**:  
   - Added button click events for checking eligibility.  
   - Implemented simple alert messages and navigation between pages.  
4. **Screenshots**: Captured the pages to include in the repository for demonstration.  
5. **Research Integration**: Input fields and logic were designed based on research paper insights.
